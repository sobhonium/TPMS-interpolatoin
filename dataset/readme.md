This folder is taking care of creating dataset. There is no problem with creating
a syntetic dataset for TPMS function as their trigonometric function representations
are available. In terms of medial axis represenation (the second part that should be added later on) we have a nice representation, but it is not implemented yet for this
subproject. As of now, the trig functions in ../minisurf/trig can help returning feature data and their labels (sdf values).
